Parapluie is a lightweight gRPC server that wraps a SQLite database, designed to provide a safe and simple way to interact with your data. 
The goal is to make the experience as straightforward as possible—no complex configurations, and no ways to accidentally harm your data. 
It's minimalistic by design, offering just the essentials for experimentation and learning.

> **Note**: Parapluie is a toy project and not intended for production use. It's a great tool for understanding gRPC and database interactions but lacks the advanced features and robustness required for real-world applications.
